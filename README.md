# 📌 Tech Tracker – Graduation Project  

## 🚀 Overview  
**Tech Tracker** is an AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize online shopping experiences.  
It aggregates product data from multiple sources, performs **product matching**, and applies **sentiment analysis** with advanced **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)** models.  

The project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze customer reviews, identify aspects of products, and determine **aspect-based sentiment** (positive/negative/neutral).

## ✨ Key Features  

- 🛒 **Product Aggregation & Matching**  
  - Scrapes product data from multiple sources.  
  - Uses **ML models** to identify and match duplicate/similar products across platforms.  

- 💬 **Sentiment Analysis**  
  - Predicts customer sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) from reviews.  
  - Built using **Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)** and **traditional ML models (SVC, XGBoost, Decision Trees)**.  

- 🔍 **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**  
  - Extracts product aspects (e.g., *price, quality, durability*) using **TF-IDF** and **LDA topic modeling**.  
  - Performs fine-grained sentiment classification per aspect.  

- 🌐 **User-Friendly Interface**  
  - **Frontend:** React  
  - **Backend:** Node.js (APIs), Python (ML models)  
  - **Database:** Microsoft SQL  

- 🎥 **Demo Available** – [Demo.mp4 inside repo]

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning  

The core of this project lies in AI:  

- **Product Matching Model**  
  - Preprocessing with OpenCV & text normalization.  
  - Feature engineering with embeddings.  
  - Classification using ML/DL models.  

- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  - Classical ML models: Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Trees, XGBoost.  
  - Deep Learning with **TensorFlow/Keras**.  

- **Aspect Sentiment Analysis**  
  - **TF-IDF vectorization** for keyword extraction.  
  - **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)** for topic/aspect discovery.  
  - Sentiment per aspect using ML models.
